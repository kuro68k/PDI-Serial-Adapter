# PDI Serial Adapter
 Add logic level RS232 to the PDI header, with an FTDI breakout

A simple 2 layer board with 3x PDI headers, and an FTDI cable header. A debug serial port is really handy, and STM debuggers have one built in.

PDI 1 - connect the debugger
PDI 2 - 2.54mm pitch cable to MCU
PDI 3 - 1.27mm pitch cable to MCU
FTDI - serial to USB cable
